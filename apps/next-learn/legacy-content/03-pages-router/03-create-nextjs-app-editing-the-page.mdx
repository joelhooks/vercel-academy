title: Editing the Page
---

Let’s try editing the starter page.

- Make sure the Next.js development server is still running.
- Open `pages/index.js` with your text editor.
- Find the text that says **"Welcome to"** under the `<h1>` tag and change it to **"Learn"**.
- Save the file.

As soon as you save the file, the browser automatically updates the page with the new text:

<Image
  alt="Learn Next.js"
  src="/learn/pages-router/create-nextjs-app/learn-nextjs.png"
  width={1030 / 2}
  height={384 / 2}
/>

The Next.js development server has [Fast Refresh](/docs/basic-features/fast-refresh) enabled. When you make changes to files, Next.js automatically applies the changes in the browser almost instantly. No refresh needed! This will help you iterate on your app quickly.

### Next Up: Creating Pages

Great job! That’s it for the first lesson.

In the next lesson, we’ll talk about _creating more pages and navigating between pages_.

> You should keep the development server running, but if you want to restart it, hit <kbd>Ctrl + c</kbd> to stop the server.

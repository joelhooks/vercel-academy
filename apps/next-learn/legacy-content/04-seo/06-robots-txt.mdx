title: What is a robots.txt File?
---

A [robots.txt file](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/intro) tells search engine crawlers which pages or files the crawler can or can't
request from your site. The `robots.txt` file is a web standard file that most [good bots](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/how-to-manage-good-bots) consume before requesting anything from a specific domain.

You might want to protect certain areas from your website from being crawled, and therefore indexed, such as your CMS or admin, user accounts in your e-commerce, or some API routes, to name a few. These files must be served at the root of each host, or alternatively you can redirect the root `/robots.txt` path to a destination URL and most bots will follow.

### How to add a robots.txt file to a Next.js project

Thanks to [static file serving](/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving) in Next.js we can easily add a `robots.txt` file. , we would create a new file named `robots.txt` the `public` folder in the root directory. An example of what you could put in this file would be:

```jsx
//robots.txt

# Block all crawlers for /accounts
User-agent: *
Disallow: /accounts

# Allow all crawlers
User-agent: *
Allow: /
```

When you run your app with `yarn dev`, it will now be available at [http://localhost:3000/robots.txt](http://localhost:3000/robots.txt) . Note that the `public` folder name is not part of the URL.

Do not name the public directory anything else. The name cannot be changed and is the only directory used to serve static assets.

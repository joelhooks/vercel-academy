## Why optimize fonts?

Fonts play a significant role in the design of a website, but using custom fonts in your project can affect performance if the font files need to be fetched and loaded.

[Cumulative Layout Shift](https://vercel.com/blog/how-core-web-vitals-affect-seo) is a metric used by Google to evaluate the performance and user experience of a website. With fonts, layout shift happens when the browser initially renders text in a fallback or system font and then swaps it out for a custom font once it has loaded. This swap can cause the text size, spacing, or layout to change, shifting elements around it.

<Image

  height="495"

Next.js automatically optimizes fonts in the application when you use the `next/font` module. It downloads font files at build time and hosts them with your other static assets. This means when a user visits your application, there are no additional network requests for fonts which would impact performance.

## Adding a primary font

Let's add a custom Google font to your application to see how this works.

In your `/app/ui` folder, create a new file called `fonts.ts`. You'll use this file to keep the fonts that will be used throughout your application.

Import the `Inter` font from the `next/font/google` module - this will be your primary font. Then, specify what [subset](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/subsetting) you'd like to load. In this case, `'latin'`:

```tsx filename="/app/ui/fonts.ts" highlight={1,3}
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';

export const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });
```

Finally, add the font to the `<body>` element in `/app/layout.tsx`:

```tsx filename="/app/layout.tsx" highlight={2,11}
import '@/app/ui/global.css';
import { inter } from '@/app/ui/fonts';

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={`${inter.className} antialiased`}>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

By adding `Inter` to the `<body>` element, the font will be applied throughout your application. Here, you're also adding the Tailwind [`antialiased`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-smoothing) class which smooths out the font. It's not necessary to use this class, but it adds a nice touch.

Navigate to your browser, open dev tools and select the `body` element. You should see `Inter` and `Inter_Fallback` are now applied under styles.

## Practice: Adding a secondary font

You can also add fonts to specific elements of your application.

Now it's your turn! In your `fonts.ts` file, import a secondary font called `Lusitana` and pass it to the `<p>` element in your `/app/page.tsx` file. In addition to specifying a subset like you did before, you should also specify different font **weights**. For example, `400` (normal) and `700` (bold).

Once you're ready, expand the code snippet below to see the solution.

> **Hints:**
>
> - If you're unsure what weight options to pass to a font, check the TypeScript errors in your code editor.
> - Visit the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and search for `Lusitana` to see what options are available.
> - See the documentation for [adding multiple fonts](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts#using-multiple-fonts) and the [full list of options](/docs/app/api-reference/components/font#font-function-arguments).

```tsx filename="/app/ui/fonts.ts" highlight={1,5-8}
import { Inter, Lusitana } from 'next/font/google';

export const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });

export const lusitana = Lusitana({
  weight: ['400', '700'],
  subsets: ['latin'],
});
```

```tsx filename="/app/page.tsx" highlight={4,8-11}
import AcmeLogo from '@/app/ui/acme-logo';
import { ArrowRightIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import Link from 'next/link';
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    // ...
    <p
      className={`${lusitana.className} text-xl text-gray-800 md:text-3xl md:leading-normal`}
    >
      <strong>Welcome to Acme.</strong> This is the example for the{' '}
      <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/" className="text-blue-500">
        Next.js Learn Course
      </a>
      , brought to you by Vercel.
    </p>
    // ...
  );
}
```

</Reveal>

Finally, the `<AcmeLogo />` component also uses Lusitana. It was commented out to prevent errors, you can now uncomment it:

```tsx filename="/app/page.tsx" highlight={7}
// ...

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col p-6">
      <div className="flex h-20 shrink-0 items-end rounded-lg bg-blue-500 p-4 md:h-52">
        <AcmeLogo />
        {/* ... */}
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Great, you've added two custom fonts to your application! Next, let's add a hero image to the home page.

## Why optimize images?

Next.js can serve **static assets**, like images, under the top-level [`/public`](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/static-assets) folder. Files inside `/public` can be referenced in your application.

With regular HTML, you would add an image as follows:

```tsx
<img
  src="/hero.png"
  alt="Screenshots of the dashboard project showing desktop version"
/>
```

However, this means you have to manually:

- Ensure your image is responsive on different screen sizes.
- Specify image sizes for different devices.
- Prevent layout shift as the images load.
- Lazy load images that are outside the user's viewport.

Image Optimization is a large topic in web development that could be considered a specialization in itself. Instead of manually implementing these optimizations, you can use the `next/image` component to automatically optimize your images.

## The `<Image>` component

The `<Image>` Component is an extension of the HTML `<img>` tag, and comes with automatic image optimization, such as:

- Preventing layout shift automatically when images are loading.
- Resizing images to avoid shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport.
- Lazy loading images by default (images load as they enter the viewport).
- Serving images in modern formats, like [WebP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#webp) and [AVIF](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#avif_image), when the browser supports it.

## Adding the desktop hero image

Let's use the `<Image>` component. If you look inside the `/public` folder, you'll see there are two images: `hero-desktop.png` and `hero-mobile.png`. These two images are completely different, and they'll be shown depending if the user's device is a desktop or mobile.

In your `/app/page.tsx` file, import the component from [`next/image`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image). Then, add the image under the comment:

```tsx filename="/app/page.tsx" highlight={5,12-18}
import AcmeLogo from '@/app/ui/acme-logo';
import { ArrowRightIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import Link from 'next/link';
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
import Image from 'next/image';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    // ...
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center p-6 md:w-3/5 md:px-28 md:py-12">
      {/* Add Hero Images Here */}
      <Image
        src="/hero-desktop.png"
        width={1000}
        height={760}
        className="hidden md:block"
        alt="Screenshots of the dashboard project showing desktop version"
      />
    </div>
    //...
  );
}
```

Here, you're setting the `width` to `1000` and `height` to `760` pixels. It's good practice to set the `width` and `height` of your images to avoid layout shift, these should be an aspect ratio **identical** to the source image. These values are _not_ the size the image is rendered, but instead the size of the actual image file used to understand the aspect ratio.

You'll also notice the class `hidden` to remove the image from the DOM on mobile screens, and `md:block` to show the image on desktop screens.

This is what your home page should look like now:

<Image
  alt="Styled home page with a custom font and hero image"
  srcLight="/learn/light/home-page-with-hero.png"
  srcDark="/learn/dark/home-page-with-hero.png"
  width="960"
  height="566"
/>

## Practice: Adding the mobile hero image

Now it's your turn! Under the image you've just added, add another `<Image>` component for `hero-mobile.png`.

- The image should have a `width` of `560` and `height` of `620` pixels.
- It should be shown on mobile screens, and hidden on desktop - you can use dev tools to check if the desktop and mobile images are swapped correctly.

Once you're ready, expand the code snippet below to see the solution.

```tsx filename="/app/page.tsx" highlight={19-25}
import AcmeLogo from '@/app/ui/acme-logo';
import { ArrowRightIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import Link from 'next/link';
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
import Image from 'next/image';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    // ...
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center p-6 md:w-3/5 md:px-28 md:py-12">
      {/* Add Hero Images Here */}
      <Image
        src="/hero-desktop.png"
        width={1000}
        height={760}
        className="hidden md:block"
        alt="Screenshots of the dashboard project showing desktop version"
      />
      <Image
        src="/hero-mobile.png"
        width={560}
        height={620}
        className="block md:hidden"
        alt="Screenshot of the dashboard project showing mobile version"
      />
    </div>
    //...
  );
}
```

Great! Your home page now has a custom font and hero images.

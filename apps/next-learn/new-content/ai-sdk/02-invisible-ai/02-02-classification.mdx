# Classification - Structuring Unstructured Data

You understand why Invisible AI matters.

Now tackle how with a powerful technique: **Classification**.

<VideoPlaceholder

### The Problem: Data Chaos

Imagine getting flooded with user feedback, support tickets, or GitHub issues. It's a goldmine of information, but it's messy! Manually reading and categorizing everything is slow, tedious, and doesn't scale.

- **Support Tickets:** Is it a billing question? A bug report? A feature request?
- **User Feedback:** Positive? Negative? A specific feature suggestion?
- **GitHub Issues:** Bug? Feature? Docs issue? Needs triage?

This is where classification shines.

We can teach an LLM our desired categories and have it automatically sort incoming text.

<VisualPlaceholder description="Conceptual diagram: Left side shows speech bubbles/text snippets labeled 'Unstructured Data'. An arrow points to a central 'AI Classification Engine' icon (maybe a brain/gear with AI symbol). Another arrow points to the right side showing structured data rows/cards labeled 'Categorized Data' with tags like 'Billing', 'Bug Report'." />

Let's look at the `support_requests.json` file from our project (`app/(2-classification)/support_requests.json`). It contains typical user messages like:

```json
// app/(2-classification)/support_requests.json (Excerpt)
[
	{
		"id": 1,
		"text": "I'm having trouble logging into my account. Can you please assist?"
	},
	{
		"id": 2,
		"text": "The export feature isn't working correctly. Is there a known issue?"
	}
	// ... more requests
]
```

Our goal is to automatically assign a category (like account_issues or product_issues) to each request.

### The Solution: generateObject + Zod Schema

Remember generateObject from our sneak peek? It's perfect for this because we want structured output. Specifically, we want each request paired with its category.

To make this work reliably, we need to tell the AI exactly what structure we expect. That's where Zod comes in. We'll define a schema that includes our text and the possible categories.

### Step 1: Define the Schema with z.enum

First, let's define our categories and the structure we want for each classified item using Zod. The z.enum() function is ideal for defining a fixed set of possible categories.

```typescript
// Define the schema for a single classified request
const classificationSchema = z.object({
	request: z.string().describe('The original support request text.'), // Describe helps the model!
	category: z
		.enum(['billing', 'product_issues', 'enterprise_sales', 'account_issues', 'product_feedback'])
		.describe('The most relevant category for the support request.'),
})
```

Builder Takeaway: Zod schema = contract. `generateObject` uses it to guide the LLM and validate responses, giving you predictable, typed data. `z.enum` is perfect for classification.

### Step 2: Classifying Multiple Items with output: 'array'

We don't just want to classify one request; we want to classify the whole list from our JSON file. generateObject makes this easy with the output: 'array' option.

Let's put it all together in our script (app/(2-classification)/classification.ts):

```typescript
import 'dotenv/config'
import { generateObject } from 'ai'
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'
import supportRequests from './support_requests.json' // Import the data
import { z } from 'zod'

// Define the schema for a single classified request
const classificationSchema = z.object({
	request: z.string().describe('The original support request text.'),
	category: z
		.enum(['billing', 'product_issues', 'enterprise_sales', 'account_issues', 'product_feedback'])
		.describe('The most relevant category for the support request.'),
})

async function main() {
	console.log('Asking AI to classify support requests...')

	// Use generateObject to get structured output
	const { object: classifiedRequests } = await generateObject({
		model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'), // A capable yet cost-effective choice
		// Prompt combines instruction + stringified data
		prompt: `Classify the following support requests based on the defined categories.\n\n${JSON.stringify(supportRequests)}`,
		// Our Zod schema defines the structure for each item
		schema: classificationSchema,
		// Crucial: Tell the SDK we expect an array of these objects
		output: 'array',
	})

	console.log('\n--- AI Response (Structured JSON) ---')
	// Output the validated, structured array
	console.log(JSON.stringify(classifiedRequests, null, 2))
	console.log('-----------------------------------')
}

main().catch(console.error)
```

Code Breakdown:

Imports: Standard imports for generateObject, openai, zod, and our JSON data.

Schema: Defines the structure for one classified item using z.object and z.enum.

Prompt: Clear instructions plus the raw data for context.

generateObject Call: Uses model, prompt, schema, and importantly, output: 'array'.

Output: Accesses the validated array via result.object.

### Step 3: Run the Script

Time to see it in action! In your terminal (project root):

```bash
pnpm classification
```

You should get a clean JSON array like this:

```json
// Terminal Output (Example)
[
	{
		"request": "I'm having trouble logging into my account. Can you please assist?",
		"category": "account_issues"
	},
	{
		"request": "The export feature isn't working correctly. Is there a known issue?",
		"category": "product_issues"
	},
	{
		"request": "I need help integrating your API with our existing system.",
		"category": "product_issues" // Note: Model might choose this or another category
	}
	// ... other requests classified ...
]
```

Success! Structured, usable data instead of messy text. Route billing questions to finance, bugs to engineering, and feature requests to product automatically.

That's classification power.

<VisualPlaceholder description="Screenshot of the terminal output showing the formatted JSON array of classified support requests." />

### Iteration 1: Adding Urgency

Let's make this even more useful. What if we wanted the AI to estimate the urgency of each request? Easy! Just add it to the schema:

```typescript
// Update the schema definition
const classificationSchema = z.object({
	request: z.string().describe('The original support request text.'),
	category: z
		.enum(['billing', 'product_issues', 'enterprise_sales', 'account_issues', 'product_feedback'])
		.describe('The most relevant category for the support request.'),
	// Add the new urgency field!
	urgency: z
		.enum(['low', 'medium', 'high'])
		.describe('Estimate the urgency based on content and tone.'),
})

// ... rest of the main function remains the same ...
```

Run `pnpm classification` again. You'll now see the urgency field added to each object, with the AI making its best guess (e.g., "high" for API integration help, "medium" for the export feature issue).

### Iteration 2: Handling Multi-Language & Refining with `.describe()`

Now, let's throw a curveball: support_requests_multilanguage.json. This file has requests in Spanish, German, Chinese, etc. Can our setup handle it?

Challenge:

Modify classification.ts:

- Change the import: `import supportRequests from './support_requests_multilanguage.json';`
- Add language: `z.string()` to the classificationSchema.
- Run `pnpm classification`.

You'll see the AI detects the languages, but maybe gives you codes ("ES"). We want full names ("Spanish").

Solution: Use `.describe()` for precision!

Update the language field in your schema:

```typescript
// Inside classificationSchema
  language: z.string().describe("The full name of the language the support request is in (e.g., English, Spanish, German)."),
```

Run the script one more time. Voil√†! Clean, full language names, thanks to our more specific schema instructions.

<Callout type="info" title="What if the AI gets it wrong?">
	The AI SDK uses your Zod schema to *validate* the LLM's output. If the model returns a category
	not in your `z.enum` list (e.g., "sales_inquiry" instead of "enterprise_sales") or fails other
	schema rules, `generateObject` will throw a validation error. This prevents unexpected data
	structures from breaking your application. You might need to refine your prompt, schema
	descriptions, or use a more capable model if validation fails often.
</Callout>

Builder Takeaway: Iteration is the name of the game. Add fields to your schema incrementally. Use .describe() to fine-tune the output for specific fields when the default isn't perfect. This schema-driven approach keeps your AI interactions predictable and robust.

## Step 4: Enhancing the UI

	description="Real-world support requests often belong to multiple categories simultaneously."
	steps={[

		"Change: `category: z.enum(['billing', ...])` to `categories: z.array(z.enum(['billing', ...]))`",
		'Update the prompt to instruct the model to assign multiple categories when appropriate',
		"Test with ambiguous requests that span multiple categories (e.g., 'I can't access my premium features after my payment went through')",
	]}
	challenge="How does the model's accuracy change with multi-label classification? Does it tend to assign too many or too few categories? How might you optimize the prompt for better multi-label results?"

  ### Advanced Zod Techniques

#### Adding Custom Validation with \`.refine()\`

Validate that a category has sufficient confidence:

\`\`\`typescript
const ClassificationSchema = z.object({
category: z.enum(['billing', 'technical', 'account', 'product_question']),
confidence: z.number().min(0).max(1),
}).refine(data => data.confidence > 0.7, {
message: "Low confidence classification, manual review needed",
path: ["confidence"]
});
\`\`\`

#### Transforming Values with \`.transform()\`

Process values after validation:

\`\`\`typescript
const ClassificationSchema = z.object({
category: z.enum(['billing', 'technical', 'account', 'product_question'])
.transform(cat => ({
value: cat,
displayName: cat.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + cat.slice(1).replace('\_', ' '),
routingTeam: getTeamForCategory(cat)
}))
});
\`\`\`

#### Custom Error Messages

Provide better feedback for invalid inputs:

\`\`\`typescript
const ClassificationSchema = z.object({
category: z.enum(['billing', 'technical', 'account', 'product_question'], {
errorMap: (issue, ctx) => {
return { message: "Invalid support category. Please check your schema definition." };
}
})
});
\`\`\`

### Key Takeaways

- Classification uses AI to assign predefined categories to text.
- generateObject with a Zod schema is the core AI SDK tool for this.
- Use `z.enum([...categories])` to define your classification labels.
- Specify `output: 'array'` to classify multiple items at once.
- Use `.describe()` on schema fields to guide the model's output format (like getting full language names).

This technique automates workflows like ticket routing, content moderation, and feedback analysis.

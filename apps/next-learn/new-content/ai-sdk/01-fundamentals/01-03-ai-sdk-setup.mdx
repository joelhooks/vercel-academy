# Project Setup - Get Your Hands Dirty!

Alright, builder! You've grasped the core LLM concepts. Now for the exciting part: setting up your local development environment. This is where you _really_ get your hands dirty and prepare to build the cool AI features we've been talking about, like automatic summarization and intelligent chatbots, using the Vercel AI SDK.

    **Video Goal:** Quick visual walkthrough of \`git clone\`, \`pnpm install\`, creating \`.env\` from \`.env.example\`, adding API key (blurring/masking key), and running \`pnpm tsx env-check.ts\` successfully.
    **Duration:** 3-5 minutes
    **Style:** Screencast
    **Content Outline:**
    1. Clone the repository
    2. Navigate to project directory
    3. Install dependencies with pnpm
    4. Create .env from .env.example
    5. Add API key (with key blurred for security)
    6. Run verification script
    7. Show successful output
  `}
/>

**Goal:** Get the starter project running locally, securely configure your OpenAI API key, and confirm everything works so you're ready to start coding AI in the next lesson. Let's go!

**Prerequisites:** Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) (v18 or later recommended), and `pnpm` ([install guide](https://pnpm.io/installation)) installed. You'll also need an [OpenAI account and API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

### Step 1: Getting the Code

First, let's grab the starter project code. This repository contains all the files and setup needed for the course. Open your terminal (or command prompt) and run this command to clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicoalbanese/build-an-ai-app-starter-dec-24.git
```

This copies the project files to your computer.

### Step 2: Navigating Into the Project

Now, move into the project directory you just cloned. Use the `cd` (change directory) command:

```bash
cd build-an-ai-app-starter-dec-24
```

Your terminal prompt should now show you're inside the `build-an-ai-app-starter-dec-24` folder.

### Step 3: Installing Dependencies

Next, install the necessary libraries (AI SDK, Next.js, etc.). This project uses `pnpm` for fast and efficient package management. Run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

<Callout title="Using npm or Yarn?">
	While `pnpm` is recommended for this project (due to the lockfile), you can *try* using `npm
	install` or `yarn install`. Be aware you might encounter slight differences if dependency versions
	vary. To install pnpm globally, run: `npm install -g pnpm`.
</Callout>

This might take a minute or two.

### Step 4: Setting Up Secrets (Your API Key)

AI models need API keys for access. These are secrets and _never_ go directly into your code. We use a special `.env` file for this.

**A. Copying the Example File**

Create your personal environment file by copying the provided example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

This creates a `.env` file which is already listed in `.gitignore`, keeping your key safe from accidental commits.

**B. Finding Your OpenAI API Key**

You need an OpenAI key to use models like GPT-4o-mini with the AI SDK.

- Head to the [OpenAI API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
- Log in or sign up.
- Click `+ Create new secret key`, name it (e.g., "AI SDK Course").
- **Crucial:** Copy the key _immediately_. You won't see it again!

**C. Editing the `.env` File**

Open the `.env` file in your code editor. Find this line:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-*************"
```

Replace the placeholder (sk-proj-...) with your actual OpenAI API key. Keep the quotes. Save the file!

<VisualPlaceholder description="Code editor showing the `.env` file with the OPENAI_API_KEY line highlighted and the key pasted in." />

D. Security First!

<Callout type="warning" title="Protect Your API Key!">
	Seriously, never commit your `.env` file or share API keys! Leaked keys = potential costs. The
	`.gitignore` helps, but always be vigilant.
</Callout>

### Step 5: Making Sure It Works!

Let's verify your setup. The project has a simple script (env-check.ts) to confirm your API key is loaded correctly. Run it:

```bash
pnpm tsx env-check.ts
```

You should see this in your terminal (with your key instead of 'sk-proj...'):

```bash
Hello, Conf!
sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx... // <-- Your key confirms success!
```

<VisualPlaceholder description="Terminal showing the successful output of 'pnpm tsx env-check.ts'." />

### Setup Success Checklist

Quickly verify your setup before moving on:

<SetupChecklist
	items={[
		{ id: 'clone', text: 'Project repository cloned and dependencies installed?' },
		{ id: 'env_create', text: '.env file created and API key configured?' },
		{ id: 'verify', text: 'env-check.ts ran successfully and showed your key?' },
		{ id: 'ready', text: 'Ready to start building AI features?' },
	]}
/>

### Common Setup Issues & Troubleshooting

<Details summary="Stuck? Click here for common solutions">
	<ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mt-2 text-sm">
		<li>
			<strong>`git: command not found`</strong>: You need to install Git. See the official [Git
			installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>`pnpm: command not found`</strong>: Install pnpm globally: `npm install -g pnpm`. Then
			try `pnpm install` again.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Node.js version errors during `pnpm install`</strong>: Ensure you have Node.js v18 or
			later. Use a tool like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node versions easily.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>`env-check.ts` shows `undefined` or errors:</strong>* Did you rename `.env.example`
			exactly to `.env` (leading dot, no extra extensions)? * Is the key name exactly
			`OPENAI_API_KEY` inside `.env`? * Did you copy the *entire* key from OpenAI (starts with
			`sk-`...)? * Did you save the `.env` file after pasting the key? * Are you running the command
			from the *root* of the `build-an-ai-app-starter-dec-24` directory?
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Other install errors (`module not found`, etc.)</strong>: Try deleting `node_modules`
			and `pnpm-lock.yaml` and run `pnpm install` again. If issues persist, check your Node/pnpm
			versions or seek help.
		</li>
	</ul>
</Details>

## Moving On: Extraction - Your First AI Script

Congratulations! Your development environment is set up and ready. You've taken the crucial first step.

Now you'll finally write and run code that uses the AI SDK to interact with an LLM and perform a practical task: extracting structured data from text. Let's start building!

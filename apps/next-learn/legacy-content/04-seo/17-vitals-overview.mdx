/>

You can approach Core Web Vitals in two different ways:

- **Try to achieve the highest score possible on each metric**. Striving for perfection is great, but it might be tricky on large websites with many dependencies.
- **Benchmark against competitors in your industry**. You are not competing with every perfectly optimized website in Google search, but with others ranking for your target keywords.

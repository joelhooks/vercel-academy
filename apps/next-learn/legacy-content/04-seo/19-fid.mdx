title: First Input Delay (FID)
---

The **First Input Delay (FID)** metric is the perception of an
end user’s experience while interacting with a web page. Imagine clicking
inside an input box only for nothing to happen – this frustration with the
interactivity and responsiveness of a site is caused by large input delays.

FID requires real user data and cannot be measured in the lab (e.g. Google Lighthouse). However, the [Total Blocking Time (TBT)](https://web.dev/tbt) metric is lab-measurable and captures issues that affect interactivity.

# System Prompts - Shaping AI Personality

Basic chatbot you built in Lesson 3.1 responds generically. System Prompts define AI's consistent character, tone, and behavioral rules across conversations.

<VideoPlaceholder
	title="Shaping Responses: The Power of System Prompts"
	brief={`
    **Video Goal:** Show API route code. Change \`system\` prompt (e.g., helpful -> riddle -> simple persona). Run app after each change, ask same question, show different outputs.
    **Duration:** 3-5 minutes
    **Style:** Screencast/Demo
    **Content Outline:**
    1. View the API route code with a basic system prompt
    2. Run the app with a standard helpful prompt
    3. Change to a riddle-based system prompt
    4. Run again and observe the different response style
    5. Change to a persona-based system prompt
    6. Run again to demonstrate personality changes
    7. Explain the impact on user experience
  `}
/>

**Goal:** Understand System Prompts. Implement `system` property in `streamText` call to customize chatbot's personality and response style.

<Callout type="info" title="Project Context">
	Continue editing API route handler `app/(5-chatbot)/api/chat/route.ts`. Frontend remains unchanged

### What are System Prompts?

System Prompts act like persistent instructions or "character notes" for AI model. Unlike user prompts (which change each turn), system prompt guides overall behavior.

- **Defines Persona:** Sets tone (e.g., formal, casual, witty, brand voice).
- **Sets Constraints:** Instructs AI on boundaries (e.g., "Do not offer financial advice", "Only discuss product features").
- **Provides Context:** Gives background relevant to all interactions (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant for Vercel products").

<VisualPlaceholder description="Diagram: Box 'System Prompt (Personality/Rules)' feeds into larger Box 'AI Model'. Box 'User Prompt (Current Question)' also feeds into 'AI Model'. 'AI Model' outputs arrow 'AI Response (Influenced by Both Prompts)'." />

**Builder Takeaway:** System Prompts control _how_ AI responds, separate from _what_ user asks. Essential for branding, safety, and consistent bot behavior.

### Implementation: The `system` Property

Add `system` property to `streamText` call in API route handler (`app/(5-chatbot)/api/chat/route.ts`). Value is string containing instructions.

```typescript
// app/(5-chatbot)/api/chat/route.ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'
import { streamText, CoreMessage } from 'ai'

export const maxDuration = 30

export async function POST(req: Request) {
	try {
		const { messages }: { messages: CoreMessage[] } = await req.json()

		const result = await streamText({
			model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
			// Add system prompt here
			system: 'You are a helpful assistant.', // Initial basic prompt
			messages,
		})

		return result.toDataStreamResponse()
	} catch (error) {
		console.error('Chat API error:', error)
		return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Failed to generate chat response.' }), {
			status: 500,
			headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
		})
	}
}
```

### Example 1: The Unhelpful Riddle Bot

Modify system property to drastically change behavior.

Update route.ts: Change system string.

```typescript
// Inside streamText call in app/(5-chatbot)/api/chat/route.ts
  system: 'You are an unhelpful assistant that only responds to users with confusing riddles.',
```

Save & Test: Run dev server (pnpm run dev). Go to http://localhost:3000/chat. Ask simple question (e.g., "What is Next.js?"). Observe riddle response.

<VisualPlaceholder description="Screenshot of chat UI. User asks 'What is Next.js?'. AI responds with a confusing riddle instead of a direct answer." />

### Example 2: The 1984 Steve Jobs Bot

Models can adopt personas. Detail improves adherence.

Update `route.ts`: Change system string to detailed persona.

```typescript
// Inside streamText call in app/(5-chatbot)/api/chat/route.ts
  system: `You are Steve Jobs. Assume his character, both strengths and flaws.
  Respond exactly how he would, in exactly his tone.
  It is 1984 you have just created the Macintosh.`,
  // Consider using gpt-4o for better persona adoption if mini struggles
  // model: openai('gpt-4o'),
```

Save & Test: Refresh chat page. Ask relevant question (e.g., "What do you think of Bill Gates?"). Observe persona reflected in response.

<VisualPlaceholder description="Screenshot of chat UI. User asks 'What do you think of Bill Gates?'. AI responds in a tone mimicking Steve Jobs in 1984." />

<Callout type="info" title="Model Selection & System Prompts">
	More capable models (like `gpt-4o` vs `gpt-4o-mini`) generally follow System Prompts more
	precisely and maintain character consistency. For production chatbots where persona is critical,
	test models to balance performance and cost.
</Callout>

### Example 3: Practical Support Assistant

Define persona and constraints for realistic application.

Update `route.ts`: Change system string to business context.

```typescript
// Inside streamText call in app/(5-chatbot)/api/chat/route.ts
  system: `You are a support assistant for TechCorp's cloud platform.
  Focus on helping users troubleshoot deployment issues, API usage, and account settings.
  Be concise but thorough. Link to documentation at docs.techcorp.com when relevant.
  If a question is outside your knowledge area, politely redirect to contact@techcorp.com.`,
```

Save & Test: Refresh chat page. Ask support-related questions (e.g., "How do I reset my password?", "Tell me about pricing"). Observe constrained, helpful responses.

<Callout type="warning" title="System Prompt Length">
	While detailed System Prompts improve behavior, very long prompts consume context window space,
	potentially affecting performance or cost. Keep prompts concise yet clear for production.
</Callout>

Builder Takeaway: Experiment with different system prompts. Test various models. Specificity and detail in system prompt improve persona adherence and constraint following.

### Key Takeaways

- **System Prompts:** Define AI's consistent personality, tone, rules via system property (streamText, generateText).
- **Behavior Control:** Shape how AI responds, independent of user's current question.
- **Branding/Persona:** Align chatbot with brand voice or character. Essential for consistent user experience.
- **Constraints:** Set boundaries (e.g., topics, response style, actions to avoid).

Iteration: Test different prompts and models. Refine based on observed behavior.

## Next Step: Connecting Your Chatbot with Tools

Your chatbot has personality, but its knowledge is limited. Now, let's give it capabilities to interact with the outside world.

This lesson introduces Tools, enabling your chatbot to call external functions or APIs (like fetching live weather data). This makes your chatbot genuinely useful and dynamic.

Now that we have a general overview of how search systems and Googlebot work, we'll deep-dive into several key parts that impact Crawling and Indexing.

In this lesson, we'll take a look at:

- HTTP status code fundamentals.
- Metadata and what web crawlers look for when parsing web content.
- How to communicate with Google so its search crawler knows when there is new content on your site.
- How to leverage meta robot tags and canonical links to indicate to search engines your desired indexing status.
